# Demo
### Each:
- Introducing themself. 

### Person 1:
- Why we chose this project: story/idea behind it (a lot of people in need + food-wasting problem = Introducing FoodForShare, an app for restaurants, food banks and personal users to donate their extra food to local community). 
- ENTHUSIASM! This is a very cool idea and app!

### Person … - User behaviour - searching :
- {example: Our app can help…(people who are in need, large families or shelters to find food). It uses google map and navigation so you can make your searching simpler in your location}
- main->search->find place

### Person … -  User behaviour continuing - creating/modifying/completing the order:
- Click on place->choose food->reserve->reservation cart->search more food->reservation history

### Person …  - Donor behaviour - creating donation:
- {example: Our app can also help rest/food banks or individuals to share their leftover food with their community and eliminate food wasting}
- Donate->save donation->donation history

### Person … - Wrap up (depending on time left):
- That was our app for sharing food.

- Tech stack we used:
- Node, Express, React, PostgreSQL

- Thanking the audience
